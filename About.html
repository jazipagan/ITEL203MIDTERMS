  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">Our team developed the website Info2Review. This website contains crucial topics with a module for second-year information technology students. The objective of this website is for students to learn about their various disciplines and enhance their studies in order to obtain a better understanding of the subjects they are taking. It benefits incoming and current second-year students by giving themÂ a variety of lessons to prepare them for future experiences. This webpage contains five separate major subjects. Each subject features a module that could help the reader learn more about that subject. This website may also help the reader in conducting further research.</p>

            <p><b>INFORMATION AND DECISION MAKING</b><br>
                People need information to plan their work, meet their deadlines and achieve their goals. They need it to analyze problems and make decisions. Information is certainly not in short supply these days, but not all of it is useful or reliable.<br><br>
                <b>• FROM DATA TO INFORMATION TO KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING</b><br>
                H D Clifton (1990) wrote that ‘one man’s information is another man’s data’, and certainly the definitions are blurred. However, it is now generally agreed that ‘data’ is pure and unprocessed – facts and figures without any added interpretation or analysis.<br><br>
                Depending on the context, data can be highly significant. Think of a cricket or football score, your name and address. Since it provides the raw material to build information, it also must be accurate. Any inaccuracies within the initial raw data will magnify as they aggregate upwards and will seriously corrupt the validity of any conclusions you draw from it or decisions you base upon it.<br><br>
                <b>• DATA </b><br>
                In a business context, data is associated with the operational aspects of the business and its day-to-day running. As such, it is often entered into a system and stored in large quantities, for example payroll data and sales figures. Such input data goes to create a data ‘set’ – names and addresses for a mail-merge file, an index to an online product database. It has to be structured correctly – all systems have some kind of validation process to check for obvious technical errors and missing data. To be reliable, the content needs to be accurate, not simply in terms of the correct number and type of characters per data field, but what the data represents in terms of meaning. This needs human intervention. Another aspect that affects accuracy is where the data comes from. You may be able to check your own in-house sources – for example, for internally generated data such as the payroll – but must depend on trust (or the reputation of the supplier) for data received from outside, for example customer credit card details.<br><br>
                <b> • INFORMATION </b><br>
                So how does ‘data’ (whether internal or external) become ‘information’? When it is applied to some purpose and is adding value which has meaning for the recipient, for example taking sets of sales figures (data) and producing a sales report on them (information).<br><br>
                • Information produced inside the organization can be supplemented by a wealth of business information produced outside – market analyses, reports, and case studies, for example. Put briefly, information by itself is only of use if it is:<br>
                • the right information (fit for the purpose)<br>
                • at the right time<br>
                • in the right format<br>
                • at the right price.<br><br>
                <b>• KNOWLEDGE</b><br>
                Just as the words ‘data’ and ‘information’ are used interchangeably, there is considerable blurring and confusion between the term’s ‘information’ and ‘knowledge’. It is helpful to think of knowledge as being of two types: the instinctive, subconscious, tacit or hidden knowledge, and the more formal, explicit, or publicly available knowledge. An everyday example of these might be the knowledge that you use when driving a car (tacit), compared with the knowledge available from a driving manual or the Highway Code (explicit).<br><br>
                In a business context, knowledge is often linked to strategic levels of management and long-term business planning. However, knowledge vital to an organization's success can come from any level within it and needs to be recognized as an important part of organizational assets. It combines information, experience and insight into a mix that is unique to every employee.<br><br>
                Let’s sum up data–information–knowledge with an everyday example. Assume that you’re trying to decide on a specialist holiday for photography enthusiasts. Here, very broadly, are the stages you will go through:<br><br>
                Stage 1: collect lots of brochures on photography holidays. This is your basic data store.<br>
                Stage 2: work through the brochures, filtering out what you don’t want by applying your own criteria to them. Some will be in places you don’t want to go to, or at the wrong time of year, or the programmed may be at the wrong level of expertise (you may be looking for some advanced tuition, and many of the holidays are geared to beginners). You can now apply your information and decide on where to go on your holiday.<br>
                Stage 3: you go on your holiday and build your knowledge from testing your actual experience of the holiday against the information you had when you booked it. This knowledge (which you can use next time you want a similar holiday) can be kept to yourself (tacit) or you can share it by reporting back to your local photography club (explicit).<br><br>
                <b>• BUILDING KNOWLEDGE – LEARNING</b><br>
                So how do we collect, process, and build our knowledge? Kolb (1985) believes that there are four stages we all go through as part of the learning cycle:<br>
                ❖ learning from feeling (through specific experience and relations with other people)<br>
                ❖ learning by watching and listening (looking at things from different perspectives, observing carefully and reflecting before making judgments)<br>
                ❖ learning by thinking (reflecting on and analyzing ideas, drawing up mental maps and planning)<br>
                ❖ learning by doing (getting things done, influencing other people, taking risks).<br><br>
                We all go through each of these processes to an extent, but different people feel more comfortable with some than with others. For example, an action-oriented person who likes to learn by doing may get very frustrated in a learning-by-watching situation or in one that requires reflection and analysis.<br><br>
                <b>LEARNING – FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE ORGANIZATION</b><br>
                ❖ People learn by seeking out information when faced with a new situation and using this information to draw conclusions and form mental models which they use as the basis for their action.<br>
                ❖ If these mental models are confirmed and reinforced by our experience in reality, then over time they become so familiar that they become routine, used automatically and with no conscious effort.<br>
                ❖ Organizations use routines, rules, and procedures as a way of sharing knowledge and creating standardized processes throughout the organization.<br>
                ❖ These are the systems we use to do our work. Such systems existed before the desktop computer, but computerization has led to sophisticated information technology (IT) systems for accessing, inputting, processing, and sharing information that can be used widely and quickly across the organization.<br>
                ❖ The problem for organizations is that routines become old learning and so embedded into our systems that they stifle creativity and the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances.<br>
                ❖ This flexibility – the ability to change and learn – is essential to organizations if they are to survive and grow.<br>
                ❖ The way organizations seek to encourage learning and the sharing of information and knowledge are important aspects of information management.<br><br>
                <b>INFORMATION COMES IN MANY FORMS</b><br>
                Here are just a few reasons why you, as a manager, need information:<br>
                You need to understand what the organization as a whole is doing, as well as understand what is happening in your own unit or department.<br>
                You need to be aware of wider industry developments that may impact on the business.<br>
                It helps day-to-day problem solving and longer-term planning.<br>
                It can avoid having to reinvent the wheel.<br>
                Being aware of different practices and other ways of doing things can spark off new ideas and facilitate change.<br><br>
                <b>FORMS OF INFORMATION</b><br>
                Forms of information include the following:<br>
                <b>Internal and external</b> – information generated inside the organization and information generated outside. External intelligence and research may be incorporated into internal reports, and issues arising from internal reports may stimulate external market research.<br>
                <b>Electronic and hard copy (paper-based) and spoken</b>. At Sun Microsystems, employees receive, on average, 100 e-mails each day, but few people work in a paperless office. Most people also use conversation with others for information.<br>
                <b>Hard and soft</b> – or quantitative and qualitative. Hard information is often derived from large quantities of precise factual data, such as figures, that lends themselves to statistical analysis. Soft information, on the other hand, tends to come from few sources and depends on opinions, feelings, impressions, and judgements.<br>
                <b>Formal and informal</b>. This is worth exploring in more depth.<br>
                Some of the formal information sources you might use every day include:<br>
                ❖ newspapers or electronic newsfeeds<br>
                ❖ magazine articles<br>
                ❖ management reports<br>
                ❖ staff disciplinary procedures<br>
                ❖ videos of product presentations<br>
                ❖ layouts, maps, blueprints.<br>
                You will also use a number of informal information sources – so informal that you might not even recognize them as such! They can include:<br>
                ❖ a chat with the managing director’s personal assistant while queuing for lunch<br>
                ❖ checking out a problem with a colleague<br>
                ❖ meeting up with colleagues from the same trade or professional association at the annual conference<br>
                ❖ informal contacts with suppliers and customers.<br>

                <b>INFORMATION GATEKEEPERS</b><br>
                Some of the most useful of these sources will be information gatekeepers. People who routinely collect, evaluate, and disseminate information in an informal way which may have nothing to do with their job role. These people are well aware of the way information flows around their local environment and can exercise an influence that goes well beyond their notional status within the organization.<br><br>

                <b>FORMAL AND INFORMAL</b><br>
                There are several reasons why managers prefer informal to formal methods of information transfer:<br>
                The response and feedback is instant. The whole process is quicker and so is perceived as more efficient (even if the information is only patchy or actually inaccurate). Being personal, it is targeted at the recipient, so some initial filtering will have been carried out (but is this the half of the picture you want and need...?). They might not know what useful formal information is available, or how to access it. Cultural reasons: decisions are often made on the basis of experience and judgment, not painstaking fact finding. In practice, it makes sense to use a mix of formal and informal, hard and soft data to get a complete picture.<br><br>

                <b>• INFORMATION AS AN AID TO DECISION MAKING</b><br>
                Much decision making is based on our inbuilt mental models and knowledge base, but this tacit information source can be corroborated and enhanced by formal decision-support mechanisms.<br><br>

                <b>• THE DECISION - MAKING PROCESS</b><br>
                How do you make decisions? Do you assemble all the facts relating to the problem? Rely on your experience and insight? Shut your eyes and hope for the best? Most people do some or all of these things at different times, depending on the nature of the decision. The key step is the second one: analyze and evaluate options. An increasing difficulty facing managers now is the speed at which these decisions In an age when managers are faced with more and more information, there is less and less time in which to evaluate its usefulness. As a result, decisions are made on the basis of partial information, wrong information – or whatever information is available, rather than appropriate. The concept of cause and effect is commonly used in the way people argue and reason.<br><br>

                <b>• LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</b><br>
                Management decisions are made at three broad levels within the organization, and each type of decision has its own characteristics.<br>
                1. <b>Operational decisions:</b> these are the day-to-day decisions affecting the running of the organization. The decisions tend to be short term (days or weeks) and need to be made quite frequently. For example, a supermarket deciding on whether it needs to order more strawberries to cope with current demand.<br>
                2. <b>Tactical decisions:</b> these have a longer time frame (months or years) and tend to be made by middle managers who are directly involved in implementing the policies of the organization. For example, a toy shop timing the start of its Christmas promotion.<br>
                3. <b>Strategic decisions:</b> these are made by top management, and since they affect the organizational plans of the whole business, possibly for a number of years, they are not made very frequently. For example, whether to sell off a subsidiary company in response to falling profits.<br><br>

                <b>GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS</b><br>
                In an ideal world, getting the right information to make decisions would be very easy. We would just type a question into our PC, or know exactly the right person we need to telephone in order to get an instant, accurate and authoritative answer. If you think of a decision you have made recently and about where the information came from, you will probably realize that it is a mix of your own knowledge, whatever information was available and maybe a chat to a couple of colleagues who always seem to have an answer or know where to find one.<br><br>

                <b>• FORMAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT</b><br>
                An organizational approach to take some of the luck out of getting the right information for decision making – for making individual knowledge explicit and sharing it across the organization – is to develop formal information systems to support managers. Computer systems that can store and manipulate information provide a structured and accessible support for management decision making. Here are descriptions of three kinds of systems in common use: management information systems (MIS), decision support systems (DSS), and executive support systems (ESS).<br>
                1. <b>Management information systems (MIS)</b><br>
                Supports management decisions by providing information in the form of reports and responses to queries to managers at different levels within an organization. The MIS database that provides the information to the manager comes from both inside and outside the organization, much of it from the data stored in transaction processing systems.<br>
                2. <b>Decision support systems (DSS)</b><br>
                Helps managers by analyzing data from a database and providing them with the results, often in the form of statistical calculations or mathematical models. It is used most often for decisions at tactical and strategic levels. The main system components are the DSS database that contains the data, and the model base which contains the mathematical models and statistical calculation routines that are used to analyze data from the database. Decision support systems are often used in situations where decisions are unstructured or semi-structured, and are good for working through ‘what if’ scenarios to calculate the effects of different decisions on outcomes.<br>
                3. <b>Executive support systems (ESS)</b><br>
                Also known as executive information systems, these are designed to support strategic business decisions. Although strategic decisions usually involve summarized information, there is often a need for a specific level of detail to pinpoint a particular problem. For example, executives in an organization that is thinking of selling off a failing subsidiary might want to try to discover where its failure lies: is it a particular market segment, a region, a product line? This will often require a drilling-down process to get from general information to highly specific data subsets. The user of an ESS will typically need to access a wide variety of databases: internal, external, those created by the individual user, and electronic mailboxes.<br>
                4. <b>Other systems</b><br>
                Increasingly, managers are looking at more sophisticated methods such as: expert systems that mimic the way a human would analyze a situation and recommend a particular course of action; Knowledge management systems that can organize, store and enable shared access to the collective knowledge of the organization. The point to remember about all of these systems is that the quality of the output is only as good as the quality of the input.<br><br>

                <b>• USING THE WEB AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE</b><br>
                Here we provide some very practical guidance on finding the information you need, both to make informed decisions and to build up your own knowledge base in your chosen area. It will not eliminate all the problems involved in finding Web-based material, but should give you some sharper tools to help you along the way.<br><br>

                <b>• SEARCH ENGINES</b><br>
                Note that although the World Wide Web is technically only a part of the Internet, it is the one that is most familiar to most people, and the terms ‘Web’ and ‘Internet’ are used interchangeably. The starting point for all Web searches is a search engine – quite literally, a force that responds to an information request by searching the Web for what it interprets as relevant material.<br>
                Search engines are also referred to here as indexes as they act like gigantic indexes to selected chunks of the Web. They take an input search word (search term) or phrase, and retrieve a set of results (hits) that relate to that term or phrase from the Web pages that they have identified, collected into a virtual database and indexed.<br><br>

                <b>There are four basic types of search tool:</b><br>
                ❖ Free text search engines<br>
                ❖ Human-generated indexes<br>
                ❖ Metasearch tools<br>
                ❖ Natural language tools.<br>
                ❖ Free Text Search Engines<br>
                Search engines retrieve a set of Web pages (hits) that match a word or phrase input by the user. They do not search the entire Web – only those pages that exist in the index of the search engine. Google (www.google.com) and Alta Vista (www.altavista.com) are currently the biggest with billions of pages each.<br>
                Since the indexing method is basically a free text search, the engine will retrieve every instance of the search term, whether it is relevant to your search or not. This means that if you’re a bird enthusiast looking for information on ‘cranes’, you will also retrieve references to heavy lifting gear, maybe crane flies and companies that have crane in their title. On the other hand, these searches may not pick up useful related terms, so a search on ‘boats’ may not select references to ‘yachts’ or ‘ships’.<br><br>

                <b>• INDEX BASED SEARCH ENGINES</b><br>
                Some companies also try to catalogue the Web. Whereas search engines use computers to create the search engine index, classified and specialist directories use humans to select and catalogue the Web pages. Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) is one of the most notable. As well as being able to enter search text, the user can also browse through the directory. For example, if you want to find a new movie, you might start with entertainment and then click movies and carry on until you find what you want. The medical gateway www.omni.ac.uk is an example. For a comprehensive list of what is available, go to www.vlib.org.<br><br>

                <b>• Meta Search Engines</b><br>
                These are not search engines themselves – more tools that know about other search tools and will submit your query to several search engines at once. Metacrawler (www.metacrawler.com) and Dogpile (www.dogpile.com) are examples.<br><br>

                <b>• NATURAL LANGUAGE SEARCH ENGINES</b><br>
                Natural language search engines are very appealing, as you can literally type in a question in the way that you would ask it. Ask Jeeves is probably the best known of these.<br><br>

                <b>• GETTING BETTER RESULTS</b><br>
                Choosing the right kind of search engine for your purpose will go a long way towards getting better search results more quickly. There are a couple of other things you can do too.<br><br>

                <b>• ADVANCED SEARCH</b><br>
                One of these is to take advantage of any advanced search facilities offered by the search engines. These should make your search more specific, and more likely to retrieve focused results rather than irrelevant hits (false drops).<br><br>

                For some search engines, such as Excite, HotBot and Lycos, this kind of search supports the use of Boolean operators. These sound alarming but are really quite simple, and consist of just three words which you can incorporate into your search phrase: AND, OR, and NOT.<br><br>

                For example, ‘bottling AND canning’ will only produce results where both the terms ‘bottling’ and ‘canning’ appear in the same item. OR will find all occurrences of the terms in your search phrase whether they are together or not. So ‘bottling OR canning’ will retrieve all items containing ‘bottling’, all items containing ‘canning’ and all items containing both terms. You will see from this that the effect of OR is to broaden your search, leading to a greater number of hits. NOT is used to narrow a search. In our example, ‘bottling NOT canning’ will retrieve items which relate to ‘bottling’ but will exclude those which contain a reference to ‘canning’.<br><br>

                <b>• BOOKMARKING</b><br>
                Finding the information once is one thing; finding it a second time is another. Make full use of your bookmarking facility to set up topic folders that you can refer to later and update periodically.<br><br>

                <b>Some tips for effective use of the Internet:</b><br>
                ❖ Be prepared to put in some time at first to surf around and get a good idea of the main websites in your area of interest<br>
                ❖ Try out different search engines to see how the results compare<br><br>

                <b>• KEEPING UP TO DATE</b><br>
                Another important aspect of quality information for decision making is that the information needs to be up to date. One way of doing this is by joining mailing lists and newsgroups in your area of interest. A good place to start is http://groups.google.com which offers a list of groups to browse in all subject areas.<br><br>

                <b>• (BOTS) OR INTELLIGENT AGENTS</b><br>
                The last few years have seen the rise of robots (bots) or intelligent agents, which can ‘learn’ your requirements and scurry around the Web looking for information on your behalf. They are more effective than average search tools for two reasons (Edmunds and Morris, 2000):<br><br>
                • An intelligent agent can make decisions on the basis of the data it acquires without needing direct instruction from the user<br>
                • Because it is able to learn about individual preferences, it can predict the likelihood of items it comes across being of interest.<br><br>

                <b>KEY ISSUES IN SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT</b><br>
                Typically, there will be times when the system won’t do what you want it to do, or you think of these questions:<br>
                • ‘Why did they design it like this?’<br>
                • ‘Why can’t I just go straight to...’<br>
                • ‘It’s useless...’<br><br>
                However, the way this system was designed probably originally depended (at least to some extent) on the way local users and managers described the jobs they wanted the system to perform. Understanding how and why systems are developed, and the possible pitfalls, provides important lessons for managers involved in future systems development. Computers have been with us for a long time, but their development has been surprisingly unpredictable. Up until the 1970s, there were few attempts to produce a clear view of computer operations. One of the first models was developed by Richard Anthony (Mason and Willcocks, 1994). This was actually a model of organizational behavior, which put forward the view that there are three basic types of decisions made within organizations:<br><br>
                • <b>Strategic:</b> - these involve setting overall goals and objectives and determining how to meet them.<br>
                • <b>Control:</b> - making sure that the organization's functions are carried out efficiently and resources are used effectively.<br>
                • <b>Operational:</b> - relating to day-to-day operations, ensuring that tasks are done properly, in the right order, at the right time.<br><br>
                From the late 1960s, it was realized that systems development actually consisted of well-defined stages, and a ‘life cycle’ view of systems emerged that formed the basis of many different methodologies for systems development (Galliers et al. 1999).<br><br>
                System development should be viewed as a continuing process in order to:<br>
                • review and correct earlier errors and misconceptions<br>
                • revisit and retune the original specification in the light of changing requirements<br>
                • deal adequately with the problem of a growing number of systems involving increasing amounts of maintenance.<br><br>

                <b>ROLE IN DEVELOPING INFORMATION SYSTEMS</b><br>
                If you are not an IT manager, where do you fit into this process? You may not realize how important you are. Recent years have seen the growth of user involvement at every stage of systems development.<br><br>
                As the impact of systems development has become visible and organization-wide, organizations have slowly realized that it has a human dimension, and that ignoring this can wipe out all the advantages of your expensive new system. Many organizations are now battling with the problem of so-called legacy systems. This is a system that was developed 20-odd years ago which was designed to solve the problems the organization faced at that time. The trouble is that 20 years on, they are out of step with evolving business needs and can hold back organizations that want to apply a more up-to-date set of routines. They are now seen to be inflexible, expensive to maintain and even more expensive to replace. This has all lent urgency to the need for genuine user involvement in systems design, and few would dispute the necessity for this. But mistakes still happen.<br><br>

                <b>INTRANETS AND EXTRANETS</b><br>
                The idea of getting computers to communicate with each other, either on a one-to-one basis or via a network, has been around for a long time. Networks are of two main types, determined by the size of the area that they cover:<br>
                • <b>Local area network (LAN)</b> - which can link computers in a single room, one building, or several buildings that are geographically close (for example, on a university campus)<br>
                • <b>Wide area network (WAN)</b> - which, as its name implies, can link computers that can be hundreds or even thousands of miles apart. An intranet is a network (LAN or WAN) that utilizes Internet technology. However, unlike the Internet, access to an intranet is restricted to specific individuals, and the data it holds will be secured behind strict data security systems or firewalls.<br>
                An extranet uses Internet technology to link together intranets in different locations. In contrast to intranet transactions, extranet transmissions take place over the Internet, and so are not secure. The Internet with such tunneling technology is known as a virtual private network (VPN). Both systems and departmental managers have been quick to seize the advantages of a corporate intranet:<br>
                • easy navigation (internal home page provides links to information)<br>
                • ability to integrate a distributed computing strategy (localized web servers residing near the content author)<br>
                • rapid prototyping (can be measured in days or even hours in some cases)<br>
                • accessible via most computing platforms<br>
                • scalable (start small, build as requirements dictate)<br>
                • extensible to many media types (video, audio, interactive applications)<br>
                • can be tied to ‘legacy’ information sources (databases, existing word processed documents, groupware [software designed for group communication and shared group use]).<br><br>

                The potential business benefits of intranets are numerous (Fishenden, 1997):<br>
                • improved information flows between employees, customers, and suppliers<br>
                • reduced geographical constraints: worldwide organizations can now communicate as a logical whole<br>
                • easy access to information through a common single interface<br>
                • better access to information = quicker and better decision making = reduced cost<br>
                • reduced cost of IT operations: Internet-derived technology is a cheap way of improving communication and data flows<br>
                • increasing an organization's profile on an international scale: selected components of an intranet can be shared via a public interface on the Internet.<br><br>

                <b>DATA SECURITY</b><br>
                Security threats can present themselves in direct form, through hackers (and as far back as 1997, it was estimated that the Internet is hacked into every 20 seconds) and through indirect information systems penetration (Mitchell et al. 1999). These indirect threats occur in four major types:<br><br>
                • <b>Worms:</b> - a worm is a program that, once established, can spread copies of itself throughout a network<br>
                • <b>Trojan horses:</b> - these are also programs that appear to be carrying out a non-malicious activity which, when activated, reveal their true destructive intent.<br>
                • <b>Logic bombs:</b> - these are programs activated by a specific event.<br>
                • <b>Viruses:</b> - like a medical virus, these ‘infect’ other programs. A popular route in for these invaders is via e-mail – and they don’t always come in as attachments. The header message is usually friendly and intriguing, encouraging the user to believe that it is a message from a friend or admirer.
                The results of these attacks can range from the irritating and embarrassing to the devastating and can include the destruction of data or its modification, interception or fabrication by unauthorized personnel.<br>
                The Melissa virus Melissa was an e-mailed virus that emerged from nowhere to overwhelm commercial, government, and military computer systems, leading the FBI to launch the biggest Internet manhunt ever. Melissa affects Word 97 and Word 2000 documents. If launched, this virus will attempt to start Microsoft Outlook to send copies of the infected document to up to 50 people in Outlook’s address book as an attachment.<br>

                Viruses often spawn ever more dangerous variants. The ‘I Love You’ virus, which appeared in Spring 2000, had 50 variants by October that year. The growth of e-commerce has seen a surge in opportunities for business fraud and other security issues.<br><br>

                <b>METHODS OF DATA SECURITY</b><br>
                There is a range of methods of varying complexity that organizations can use to protect themselves from unauthorized access. <br>
                <b>Data security method</b><br>
                • <b>Data encryption:</b> - Scrambles the data before and during transmission. Use this method when data protection is important.<br>
                • <b>Key management:</b> - Acts like a ‘key’ to access encrypted data. Maximum protection to protect data from unauthorized parties. Use in conjunction with data encryption.<br>
                • <b>Digital certificate:</b> - Like a watermark on a bank cheque – this is an electronic ID card that establishes your credentials when doing business on the Web.<br>
                • <b>Firewalls:</b> - The first line of defense from the outside. Acts as a security guard for the company’s internal network, filtering all incoming traffic from the Internet. A good tool for networks connected to the Internet.<br>
                • <b>User authentication:</b> - Verifies the identity of the user. Could also be used to restrict access to certain resources within the network. A requirement for any user accessing a corporate network.<br>
                • <b>Intrusion detection system:</b> - Scans the network for abnormal activity and security breaches. A minimal requirement for any corporate network.<br>
                • <b>Virus detection:</b> - Scans the network data for viruses, providing both prevention and cure if updated regularly. One of the best defenses for data protection.<br>
                • <b>Virtual private networks:</b> - A secure private data network developed on a public data network like the Internet.<br>

                <b>DATA PROTECTION</b><br>
                Another aspect of information security is data protection. One of the effects of increasing globalization of business activities and cross-border data transactions has been to raise awareness of the need to safeguard personal details which are held in either manual or electronic systems.
                Several basic principles of data protection have now been established and codified in law. For example, in the UK, anyone processing personal data must comply with the enforceable principles of good practice.<br><br>
                These are that personal data (which includes facts and opinions, and information regarding the intentions of the holder of the data towards the individual) must be:<br>
                • fairly and lawfully processed<br>
                • processed for limited purposes (for example legitimate business purposes)<br>
                • adequate, relevant and not excessive<br>
                • accurate<br>
                • not kept longer than necessary<br>
                • processed in accordance with the data subject’s rights<br>
                • secure<br>
                • not transferred to other countries without adequate protection.<br><br>
                Every organization, whether government, public or private sector, needs to devise its own specific security arrangements. The following provides a useful checklist of good practice in information security management.<br><br>
                Good practice in information security management:<br>
                • Draw up a security policy document<br>
                • Allocate specific security responsibilities<br>
                • Institute security awareness and training programs for staff<br>
                • Have a formal reporting procedure for security incidents, and make sure that staff are aware of it<br>
                • Implement good antivirus controls, updated daily (a problem here can be with mobile staff who spend a lot of time on the road and forget to update)<br>
                • Identify risks to business operations and develop disaster plans<br>
                • Control proprietary software copying – make sure that only software developed by or licensed to the company is used<br>
                • Safeguard organizational records to protect them from loss or falsification<br>
                • Comply with your country’s data protection legislation and ensure that the information you record is only used for general business purposes<br>
                • Monitor compliance with security policy throughout the organization and review arrangements periodically<br><br>

                <b>EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE</b><br><br>
                This is formal, easily identifiable and general knowledge, the sort you find in mathematical expressions, or specifications and manuals. Because it is explicit and obvious, it can easily be transmitted between individuals.<br><br>
                <b>TACIT KNOWLEDGE</b><br><br>
                This is difficult to articulate, as it is personal, ‘hidden’ knowledge, embedded in an individual’s experience and colored by their personal beliefs and values.<br><br>
                <b>BUILDING BLOCKS OF KNOWLEDGE CREATION</b><br><br>
                These are the two basic building blocks of knowledge creation. The assumption is that knowledge is created through the dynamic interaction between explicit and tacit knowledge.<br><br>
                For organizations to succeed, they need to find ways to make explicit and share the wealth of tacit knowledge that is locked up within individual employees’ experience. Nonaka and Takeuchi saw the explicit/tacit relationship as a spiral process, in which interaction takes place repeatedly. Willard (1999) reworked and simplified their original spiral (see Figure 6), and sees the sequence in this way:<br>
                • Someone has a bright idea, and finds a way (sometimes easily, sometimes with great difficulty) of expressing that idea. This means that the idea moves from the tacit (personal knowledge and experience) to the explicit – expressed in a way that everyone can understand.<br>
                • The person who had the idea combines this with other known elements to form some kind of context (so we have explicit added to explicit).<br>
                • This is then communicated to colleagues, who begin to ‘get the picture’ and start to think about it on the basis of their own knowledge (so the explicit idea moves to tacit reflection and analysis).<br>
                • Through discussion, the idea grows and develops, and colleagues all contribute to the implicit understanding that builds up (adding tacit to tacit).<br>
                • New ways are found to express the idea, more people are informed and the idea is increasingly combined to present a bigger idea (and so on).<br>
                • The new understanding is now institutionalized – turned into a working procedure or implemented as a working practice or rule.<br><br>

                <b>KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND LEARNING</b><br>
                An important aspect of knowledge management is the way people (and organizations) learn and how they approach problem-solving. This is a good point to revisit Argyris and Schön’s theories-in-use (the private, self-generated theories that govern our behavior).<br><br>
                Argyris and Schön (1974) built a model of the processes involved in the theory in practice (see Figure 6) that has three elements:<br>
                • Governing variables (or values): there are likely to be a number of these and any action taken is likely to impact on them.<br>
                • Action strategies: what people do to keep their governing values within an acceptable range.<br>
                • Consequences: what happens as the result of an action. Consequences can be intended or unintended. Where the consequences of your action strategy are in accord with your governing values, the theory-in-use is confirmed. But what happens if the consequences work against your governing values?
                Argyris and Schön suggest that there are two responses to this mismatch, which they describe as single-loop learning and double-loop learning.<br><br>

                <b>SINGLE-LOOP LEARNING</b><br>
                When something goes wrong, a common response is to look for another strategy that will work better, but still within the framework of existing governing variables or values. – the plans, goals, or rules of behavior that we are familiar with. This is single-loop learning. Looked at in organizational terms, error and correction in a single-loop learning environment will work within the organization's existing policies and objectives, but otherwise carry on with these unchanged.<br><br>

                <b>DOUBLE-LOOP LEARNING</b><br>
                A more radical approach is to examine critically the governing variables or values themselves, to test how valid they still are. This in turn can lead to a change in the whole framework in which the action strategies and consequences are developed – a double-loop (see Figure 8).<br>
                Double-loop learning will occur when errors are corrected in ways that involve the modification of the organization's underlying norms, policies, and objectives. Argyris and Schön argue that double-loop learning must be maximized if organizations are to make informed decisions in rapidly changing contexts. It is an approach that accords very well with the underlying values of knowledge management.<br><br>

                <b>BENEFITS OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT</b><br>
                Several business benefits have been identified as accruing from knowledge management (Newing, 2000):<br>
                • identifying new markets from high-level intelligence gathering and pooling of knowledge by experts<br>
                • more responsiveness to market needs by harnessing external knowledge<br>
                • using customer knowledge to improve existing products and create innovative new ones<br>
                • faster time to market<br>
                • better quality products<br>
                • reusing knowledge gained in other parts of the world for other customers with similar problems<br>
                • continuous learning and development of best practice<br>
                • reducing costs associated with finding and reinventing knowledge by quickly retrieving explicit knowledge already stored<br>
                • improving customer service by applying knowledge at the point of first interaction with the customer<br>
                • reduction of risk by using wider expertise.<br><br>

                <b>CHALLENGES AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS</b><br>
                Even if your organization has taken on board, the message that using your corporate knowledge more intelligently can be a vital component in competing in the marketplace, it may well face a number of basic problems before it can get underway (Bonaventura, 1997).<br><br>

                <b>BARRIERS TO KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT</b><br>
                There may be, for example:<br>
                • no model for knowledge creation and dissemination within the organization: you’ve never done it before so where do you start?<br>
                • no processes or systems focused on supporting those activities – they weren’t part of the original systems specification so where do they fit in now?<br>
                • Von Krogh et al. (2000) believe that managers ought to be supporting knowledge rather than trying to manage it, as it is basically unmanageable and not amenable to traditional management techniques.<br>
                • Individual staff may be unwilling to accept new lessons, insights, and ideas, and many organizations can be quite challenging places for people learning to overcome the barriers of sharing knowledge with others.<br><br>

                <b>INDIVIDUAL BARRIERS</b><br>
                Individual barriers can include the following:<br>
                • People approach new experiences based on their experience and beliefs about the world. There will be some situations which are so new and different that they will not have developed a response to them and will find them too challenging.<br>
                • Some people will see new knowledge as a threat to their self-image and respond negatively to it.<br><br>

                <b>ORGANIZATION BARRIERS</b><br>
                The organization itself may contain its own barriers:<br>
                • New ideas will have to be made explicit in a ‘language’ that people in the organization can understand.<br>
                • The organizational memory and understanding of how things work can be good for bonding people together – but also make it more difficult for an individual to disagree with a ‘party line’<br>
                • Organizational procedures may make cross-functional interactions difficult.<br><br>

                <b>THE SEVEN C’s OF COMMUNITIES</b><br>
                <b>• Context</b> – the community sets the context for knowledge sharing and creation.<br>
                <b>• Contribution</b> – members know where and how to contribute.<br>
                <b>• Creation</b> – knowledge is created through the interaction of members.<br>
                <b>• Collaboration</b> – members collaborate to build on each other’s ideas.<br>
                <b>• Consensus</b> – members agree on best practices and how to take ideas forward.<br>
                <b>• Content</b> – knowledge is captured as reusable content.<br>
                <b>• Capitalization</b> – the organization can exploit new knowledge and best practices.<br><br>

                <b>APPROACHES TO KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT</b><br>
                Skyrme (1998) reports that in analyzing the way that over 100 organizations apply knowledge management, two main approaches have been identified:<br>
                Sharing existing knowledge so that organizations don’t reinvent the wheel because the knowledge they need is available but not known to them.
                Creating new knowledge and converting it into new products, services, and processes, enabling better, faster innovation.<br>
                Skyrme found that in both approaches, organizations tend to focus on a few knowledge ‘levers’ to strengthen their knowledge-building efforts:<br>
                <b>• Customer knowledge</b> – develop deep knowledge-sharing relationships, and understand the needs of your customers’ customers <br>
                <b>• Stakeholder relationships</b> – improve knowledge flows between suppliers, employees, shareholders <br>
                <b>• Business environment insights</b> – systematically scan your political, economic environment, etc. and monitor what your competitors are doing <br>
                <b>• Organizational memory</b> – share knowledge through best practice databases, directories of expertise, intranets <br>
                <b>• Knowledge in processes</b> – embed knowledge into business processes and management decision making.<br><br>

                The knowledge created within an organization must add value (Tissen et al. 1998). If the creation of knowledge is to be successfully directed, then the people involved in it must be too.<br><br>

                <b>IMPROVING KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT</b><br>
                • Create knowledge databases of best practice, expertise, client profiles, legislative developments<br>
                • Create a knowledge map (a visual representation of information and relationships)<br>
                • Actively manage processes for collecting, classifying, storing, and disseminating information<br>
                • Develop knowledge centers that are focal points for specific knowledge, and knowledge webs – networks of experts<br>
                • Introduce collaborative technologies like intranets or groupware<br>
                • Appoint a senior executive to be responsible for the knowledge initiative<br><br>

                <b>STEPS TO KNOWLEDGE MOBILIZATION</b><br>
                Let’s look at these steps in more detail, with examples provided by Miller (1998) that illustrate how some organizations have put theory into practice:<br>
                <b>• Start with a business strategy</b> – before you start changing things, you must understand the business strategy to which knowledge mobilization can contribute.<br>
                <b>• Create a knowledge-sharing culture</b> – easier said than done! But if your culture is one that says ‘knowledge is power’ and your pay and benefits system rewards the notice of knowledge, then the system has to change.<br>
                <b>• Get the right structure</b> – flatter organizational structures (rather than many hierarchical levels) encourage knowledge sharing.<br>
                <b>• Create a dedicated team</b> – changing culture is a major initiative and needs a dedicated team to push it forward. This team will raise the knowledge profile and publicize the organization's commitment to knowledge sharing.<br>
                <b>• Help people to feel secure</b> – employees don’t willingly share knowledge if they feel their jobs are under threat, and organizations must acknowledge this.<br>
                <b>• Reward those who share knowledge</b> – knowledge contributions need to be recognized in the pay structure.<br>
                <b>• Ensure commitment from the top</b> – the role of the CEO is essential to culture change. Employees need to see top management promoting knowledge sharing if they are expected to do so.<br>
                <b>• Capture soft knowledge</b> – connect people with people, and create multilevel networks to capture soft knowledge.<br>
                <b>• Handle technology with care</b> – technology can enable knowledge mobilization, but it’s useless without the necessary culture.<br>
                <b>• Maximize employee know</b>-how through active learning – cascade learning throughout the organization – cross-functional knowledge sharing increases awareness of roles and responsibilities.<br>
                <b>• Persist and measure</b> – when people leave, they take their training and knowhow with them. Organizations need to capture that knowledge.<br>
                <b>• Share with other companies and get a win-win strategy</b> – be open to the idea of sharing non-sensitive information with other companies.<br><br>

            <p><b>What is a Database?</b><br>
                A database is a collection of related data which represents some aspect of the real world. <br>
                A database system is designed to be built and populated with data for a certain task.<br>
                <b>What is DBMS?</b><br>
                Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data. DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement. The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application.<br><br>
                <b>Example of a DBMS</b><br>
                Let us see a simple example of a university database. This database is maintaining information concerning students, courses, and grades in a university environment. The database is organized as five files:<br>
                The STUDENT file stores data of each student<br>
                The COURSE file stores contain data on each course.<br>
                The SECTION stores the information about sections in a particular course.<br>
                The GRADE file stores the grades which students receive in the various sections<br>
                The TUTOR file contains information about each professor.<br><br>
                To define a database system:<br>
                <b>History of DBMS</b><br>
                Here, are the important landmarks from the history:<br>
                <b>1960 </b>- Charles Bachman designed first DBMS system<br>
                <b>1970</b> - Codd introduced IBM'S Information Management System (IMS)<br>
                <b>1976</b>- Peter Chen coined and defined the Entity-relationship model also know as the ER model<br>

                <b>Characteristics of Database Management System</b><br>
                Provides security and removes redundancy<br>
                Self-describing nature of a database system<br>
                Insulation between programs and data abstraction<br>
                Support of multiple views of the data<br>
                Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing<br>
                DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables.<br>
                It follows the ACID concept (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability).<br>
                DBMS supports multi-user environment that allows users to access and manipulate data in parallel.<br>
                <b>Types of DBMS</b><br>
                <b>Four Types of DBMS systems are:</b><br>
                <b>A. Hierarchical DBMS</b><br>
                In a Hierarchical database, model data is organized in a tree-like structure. Data is Stored Hierarchically (top down or bottom up) format. Data is represented using a parent-child relationship. In Hierarchical DBMS parent may have many children, but children have only one parent.<br><br>
                <b>B. Network Model</b><br>
                The network database model allows each child to have multiple parents. It helps you to address the need to model more complex relationships like as the orders/parts many-to-many relationship. In this model, entities are organized in a graph which can be accessed through several paths.<br><br>
                <b>C. Relational model</b><br>
                Relational DBMS is the most widely used DBMS model because it is one of the easiest. This model is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables. Relational model stored in fixed structures and manipulated using SQL.<br><br>
                <b>D. Object-Oriented Model</b><br>
                In Object-oriented Model data stored in the form of objects. The structure which is called classes which display data within it. It defines a database as a collection of objects which stores both data member’s values and operations.<br><br>
                <b>Advantages of DBMS</b><br>
                DBMS offers a variety of techniques to store & retrieve data<br>
                DBMS serves as an efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data<br>
                Uniform administration procedures for data<br>
                Application programmers never exposed to details of data representation and storage.<br>
                A DBMS uses various powerful functions to store and retrieve data efficiently.<br>
                Offers Data Integrity and Security<br>
                The DBMS implies integrity constraints to get a high level of protection against prohibited access to data.<br>
                A DBMS schedules concurrent access to the data in such a manner that only one user can access the same data at a time<br>
                Reduced Application Development Time<br><br>
                <b>Disadvantage of DBMS</b><br>
                DBMS may offer plenty of advantages but, it has certain flawsCost of Hardware and Software of a DBMS is quite high which increases the budget of your organization.<br>
                Most database management systems are often complex systems, so the training for users to use the DBMS is required.<br>
                In some organizations, all data is integrated into a single database which can be damaged because of electric failure or database is corrupted on the storage media<br>
                Use of the same program at a time by many users sometimes lead to the loss of some data.<br>
                DBMS can't perform sophisticated calculations<br>
                When not to use a DBMS system?<br>
                Although, DBMS system is useful. It is still not suited for specific task mentioned below:<br>
                Not recommended when you do not have the budget or the expertise to operate a DBMS. In such cases, Excel/CSV/Flat Files could do just fine.<br><br>
                <p><b>Introduction to SQL</b><br>
                SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This tutorial will give you a quick start to SQL. It covers most of the topics required for a basic understanding of SQL and to get a feel of how it works.<br><br>
                <b>A. Why to Learn SQL?</b><br>
                SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.<br><br>
                SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.<br><br>
                Also, they are using different dialects, such as −<br>
                • MS SQL Server using T-SQL,<br>
                • Oracle using PL/SQL,<br>
                • MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.<br><br>
                <b>B. Applications of SQL</b><br>
                As mentioned before, SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases. I'm going to list few of them here:<br>
                • Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.<br>
                • Allows users to describe the data.<br>
                • Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.<br>
                • Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & precompilers.<br>
                • Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.<br>
                • Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.<br>
                • Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.<br>
                SQL is a language to operate databases; it includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows, etc. SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard language, but there are many different versions of the SQL language.<br><br>
                <b>C. What is SQL?</b><br>
                SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.<br>
                SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.<br>
                Also, they are using different dialects, such as −<br>
                • MS SQL Server using T-SQL,<br>
                • Oracle using PL/SQL,<br>
                • MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.<br>
                <b>D. Why SQL?</b><br>
                SQL is widely popular because it offers the following advantages −<br>
                • Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.<br>
                • Allows users to describe the data.<br>
                • Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.<br>
                • Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & precompilers.<br>
                • Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.<br>
                • Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.<br>
                • Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.<br><br>
                <b>E. A Brief History of SQL</b><br>
                <b>• 1970</b> − Dr. Edgar F. "Ted" Codd of IBM is known as the father of relational databases. He described a relational model for databases.<br>
                <b>• 1974</b> − Structured Query Language appeared.<br>
                <b>• 1978 </b>− IBM worked to develop Codd's ideas and released a product named System/R.<br>
                <b>• 1986</b> − IBM developed the first prototype of relational database and standardized by ANSI. The first relational database was released by Relational Software which later came to be known as Oracle.<br><br>
                <b>F. SQL Process</b><br>
                When you are executing an SQL command for any RDBMS, the system determines the best way to carry out your request and SQL engine figures out how to interpret the task.<br>
                There are various components included in this process.<br>
                These components are −<br>
                • Query Dispatcher<br>
                • Optimization Engines<br>
                • Classic Query Engine<br>
                • SQL Query Engine, etc.<br>
                A classic query engine handles all the non-SQL queries, but a SQL query engine won't handle logical files.<br><br>
                <b>G. SQL Commands</b><br>
                The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into the following groups based on their nature −<br>
                <b>A. DDL - Data Definition Language</b><br><br>
                <b>CREATE</b><br>

                SELECT Column Example<br>
                The following SQL statement selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the "Customers" table:<br>
                Example<br>
                SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;<br><br>
                The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the "Customers" table:<br>
                Example<br>
                SELECT * FROM Customers;<br><br>
                The SQL INSERT INTO Statement<br>
                The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.<br>
                INSERT INTO Example<br><br>
                Assume we wish to insert a new row in the "Customers" table.<br>
                We can use the following SQL statement:<br>
                Example<br>
                INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)<br>

                Example<br>
                UPDATE Customers<br>
                SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Hamburg'<br>
                WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';<br><br>
                The SQL DELETE Statement<br>
                The DELETE statement is used to delete rows in a table.<br>
                SQL DELETE Example<br>
                Assume we wish to delete the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table.<br>
                We use the following SQL statement:<br>
                Example<br>
                DELETE FROM Customers<br>
                WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste' AND ContactName='Maria Anders';<br><br>
                DDL Sample Queries<br>
                SQL CREATE DATABASE Example<br>
                The following SQL statement creates a database called "my_db":<br>
                CREATE DATABASE my_db;<br>
                SQL CREATE TABLE Example<br>
                Now we want to create a table called "Persons" that contains five columns: PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, and City.<br>
                <br>
                Example<br>
                CREATE TABLE Persons<br>
                (<br>
                PersonID int,<br>

                The TRUNCATE TABLE Statement<br>
                What if we only want to delete the data inside the table, and not the table itself?<br>
                Then, use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement:<br>
                TRUNCATE TABLE table_name<br>
                The ALTER TABLE Statement<br>
                The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.<br>
                To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:<br>
                ALTER TABLE table_name<br>
                ADD column_name datatype<br>
                To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):<br>
                ALTER TABLE table_name<br>
                DROP COLUMN column_name<br></p>

            <b>SQL Syntax</b><br>
            SQL is followed by a unique set of rules and guidelines called Syntax. This module gives you a quick start with SQL by listing all the basic SQL Syntax.<br>
            All the SQL statements start with any of the keywords like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, CREATE, USE, SHOW and all the statements end with a semicolon (;).<br>
            The most important point to be noted here is that SQL is case insensitive, which means SELECT and select have the same meaning in SQL statements. Whereas, MySQL makes a difference in table names. So, if you are working with MySQL, then you need to give table names as they exist in the database.<br><br>

            <b>Various Syntax in SQL</b><br>
            All the examples given in this module have been tested with a MySQL server.<br>

            <b>Data Type</b><br>
            SQL Data Type is an attribute that specifies the type of data of any object. Each column, variable and expression has a related data type in SQL. You can use these data types while creating your tables. You can choose a data type for a table column based on your requirement.<br><br>

            <b>What is an Operator in SQL?</b><br>
            An operator is a reserved word or a character used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operation(s), such as comparisons and arithmetic operations. These Operators are used to specify conditions in an SQL statement and to serve as conjunctions for multiple conditions in a statement.<br>
            • Arithmetic operators<br>
            • Comparison operators<br>
            • Logical operators<br>
            • Operators used to negate conditions<br><br>
            <b>SQL Logical Operators</b><br>
            <b>Operator & Description</b><br>
            <b>1. ALL</b><br>
            The ALL operator is used to compare a value to all values in another value set.<br>
            <b>2. AND</b><br>
            The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.<br>
            <b>3. ANY</b><br>
            The ANY operator is used to compare a value to any applicable value in the list as per the condition.<br>
            <b>4. BETWEEN</b><br>
            The BETWEEN operator is used to search for values that are within a set of values, given the minimum value and the maximum value.<br>
            <b>5. EXISTS</b><br>
            The EXISTS operator is used to search for the presence of a row in a specified table that meets a certain criterion.<br>
            <b>6. IN</b><br>
            The IN operator is used to compare a value to a list of literal values that have been specified.<br>
            <b>7. LIKE</b><br>
            The LIKE operator is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operators.<br>
            <b>8. NOT</b><br>
            The NOT operator reverses the meaning of the logical operator with which it is used. Eg: NOT EXISTS, NOT BETWEEN, NOT IN, etc. This is a negate operator.<br>
            <b>9. OR</b><br>
            The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.<br>
            <b>10 .IS NULL</b><br>
            The NULL operator is used to compare a value with a NULL value.<br>
            <b>11. UNIQUE</b><br>
            The UNIQUE operator searches every row of a specified table for uniqueness (no duplicates).<br><br>
            <b>Expressions</b><br>
            An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators and SQL functions that evaluate to a value. These SQL EXPRESSIONs are like formulae and they are written in query language. You can also use them to query the database for a specific set of data.<br><br>
            Consider the basic syntax of the SELECT statement as follows −<br>
            SELECT column1, column2, columnN <br>
            FROM table_name <br>
            WHERE [CONDITION|EXPRESSION];<br>
            There are different types of SQL expressions, which are mentioned below −<br>
            • Boolean<br>
            • Numeric<br>
            • Date<br>
            Let us now discuss each of these in detail.<br>
            <b>Boolean Expressions</b><br>
            SQL Boolean Expressions fetch the data based on matching a single value. Following is the syntax −<br>
            SELECT column1, column2, columnN <br>
            FROM table_name <br>
            WHERE SINGLE VALUE MATCHING EXPRESSION;<br>
            <b>Numeric Expression</b><br>
            These expressions are used to perform any mathematical operation in any query. Following is the syntax −<br>
            SELECT numerical_expression as OPERATION_NAME<br>
            [FROM table_name<br>
            WHERE CONDITION] ;<br>
            <b>CREATE DATABASE</b><br>
            The SQL CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of this CREATE DATABASE statement is as follows −<br><br>
            CREATE DATABASE DatabaseName;<br>
            Always the database name should be unique within the RDBMS.<br>
            B. Example<br>
            If you want to create a new database <testDB>, then the CREATE DATABASE statement .<br><br>
            <b>DROP DATABASE</b><br>
            The SQL DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing database in SQL schema.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of DROP DATABASE statement is as follows −<br>
            DROP DATABASE DatabaseName;<br>
            Always the database name should be unique within the RDBMS.<br>
            B. Example<br>
            If you want to delete an existing database <testDB>, then the DROP DATABASE<br><br>
            <b>USE Statement</b><br>
            When you have multiple databases in your SQL Schema, then before starting your operation, you would need to select a database where all the operations would be performed.<br><br>
            CREATE TABLE<br>
            Creating a basic table involves naming the table and defining its columns and each column's data type.<br>
            The SQL CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement is as follows −<br>
            CREATE TABLE table_name(<br>
            column1 datatype,<br>
            column2 datatype,<br>
            column3 datatype,<br>
            .....<br>
            columnN datatype,<br>
            <b> PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )</b><br>
            );<br><br>
            <b>CREATE TABLE</b> is the keyword telling the database system what you want to do. In this case, you want to create a new table. The unique name or identifier for the table follows the CREATE TABLE statement.<br>
            Then in brackets comes the list defining each column in the table and what sort of data type it is. The syntax becomes clearer with the following example.<br>
            A copy of an existing table can be created using a combination of the CREATE TABLE statement and the SELECT statement. You can check the complete details at Create Table Using another Table.<br><br>
            <b>DROP TABLE</b><br>
            Now, you have CUSTOMERS table available in your database which you can use to store the required information related to customers.<br>
            The SQL DROP TABLE statement is used to remove a table definition and all the data, indexes, triggers, constraints and permission specifications for that table.<br>
            NOTE − You should be very careful while using this command because once a table is deleted then all the information available in that table will also be lost forever.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of this DROP TABLE statement is as follows −<br>
            DROP TABLE table_name;<br><br>
            <b>INSERT INTO</b><br>
            The SQL INSERT INTO Statement is used to add new rows of data to a table in the database.<br>
            Syntax<br>
            There are two basic syntaxes of the INSERT INTO statement which are shown below.<br>
            INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (column1, column2, column3,...columnN) <br>
            VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...valueN);<br>
            Here, column1, column2, column3,...columnN are the names of the columns in the table into which you want to insert the data.<br>
            You may not need to specify the column(s) name in the SQL query if you are adding values for all the columns of the table. But make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.<br>
            The SQL INSERT INTO syntax will be as follows −<br>
            INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...valueN);<br><br>
            <b>SELECT</b><br>
            The SQL SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table which returns this data in the form of a result table. These result tables are called result-sets.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is as follows −<br>
            SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;<br><br>
            <b>UPDATE</b><br>
            The SQL UPDATE Query is used to modify the existing records in a table. You can use the WHERE clause with the UPDATE query to update the selected rows, otherwise all the rows would be affected.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of the UPDATE query with a WHERE clause is as follows −<br>
            UPDATE table_name<br>
            SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN<br>
            WHERE [condition];<br><br>
            <b>DELETE</b><br>
            The SQL DELETE Query is used to delete the existing records from a table.<br>
            You can use the WHERE clause with a DELETE query to delete the selected rows, otherwise all the records would be deleted.<br>
            A. Syntax<br>
            The basic syntax of the DELETE query with the WHERE clause is as follows −<br>
            DELETE FROM table_name<br>
            WHERE [condition];<br>

            <b>Relational Database Management System</b><br><br>

    <b>What is RDBMS?</b><br>
    <b>RDBMS</b> stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.<br>
    A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.<br><br>

    <b>What is a table?</b><br>
    The data in an RDBMS is stored in database objects which are called as tables. This table is basically a collection of related data entries and it consists of numerous columns and rows.<br><br>

    <b>What is a field?</b><br>
    Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the CUSTOMERS table consist of ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS and SALARY.<br>
    A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.<br><br>

    <b> What is a Record or a Row?</b><br>
    A record is also called as a row of data is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 7 records in the above CUSTOMERS table. Following is a single row of data or record in the CUSTOMERS table –<br><br>

    <b>What is a column?</b><br>
    A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.<br><br>

    <b> What is a NULL value?</b><br>
    A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank, which means a field with a NULL value is a field with no value.<br>
    It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is the one that has been left blank during a record creation.<br><br>

    <b>SQL Constraints</b><br>
    Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.<br>
    Constraints can either be column level or table level. Column level constraints are applied only to one column whereas, table level constraints are applied to the entire table.<br><br>

    Following are some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL −<br>
    <b>• NOT NULL Constraint</b> − Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.<br>
    <b>• DEFAULT Constraint</b> − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.<br>
    <b>• UNIQUE Constraint </b>− Ensures that all the values in a column are different.<br>
    <b>• PRIMARY Key</b> − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.<br>
    <b>• FOREIGN Key </b>− Uniquely identifies a row/record in any another database table.<br>
    <b>• CHECK Constraint</b> − The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.<br>
    <b>• INDEX</b> − Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.<br><br>

    <b> Data Integrity</b><br>
    The following categories of data integrity exist with each RDBMS −<br>
    <b>• Entity Integrity </b>− There are no duplicate rows in a table.<br>
    <b>• Domain Integrity </b>− Enforces valid entries for a given column by restricting the type, the format, or the range of values.<br>
    <b>• Referential integrity</b> − Rows cannot be deleted, which are used by other records.<br>
    <b>• User-Defined Integrity </b>− Enforces some specific business rules that do not fall into entity, domain or referential integrity.<br><br>

    <b>Database Normalization</b><br>
    <b>Normalization</b> is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.<br>
    Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalization in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.<br>
    The inventor of the relational model Edgar Codd proposed the theory of normalization with the introduction of the First Normal Form, and he continued to extend theory with Second and Third Normal Form. Later he joined Raymond F. Boyce to develop the theory of Boyce-Codd Normal Form.<br><br>

    <b>Here is a list of Normal Forms</b><br>
    • 1NF (First Normal Form)<br>
    • 2NF (Second Normal Form)<br>
    • 3NF (Third Normal Form)<br>
    • BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)<br><br>

    Database Normalization Example can be easily understood with the help of a case study. Assume, a video library maintains a database of movies rented out.<br><br>

    <b>1NF (First Normal Form) Rules</b><br>
    • Each table cell should contain a single value.<br>
    • Each record needs to be unique.<br><br>

    <b>What is a KEY?</b><br>
    A KEY is a value used to identify a record in a table uniquely. A KEY could be a single column or combination of multiple columns<br><br>

    <b>What is a Primary Key?</b><br>
    A primary is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely.<br>
    It has following attributes:<br>
    • A primary key cannot be NULL<br>
    • A primary key value must be unique<br>
    • The primary key values should rarely be changed<br>
    • The primary key must be given a value when a new record is inserted.<br><br>

    <b>What is Composite Key?</b><br>
    A<b> composite key </b>is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely<br>
    In our database, we have two people with the same name Robert Phil, but they live in different places.<br>
    Hence, we require both Full Name and Address to identify a record uniquely. That is a composite key.<br><br>

    <b>2NF (Second Normal Form) Rules</b><br>
    • Rule 1- Be in 1NF<br>
    • Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key<br><br>

    <b>Database - Foreign Key</b><br>
    Foreign Key references the primary key of another Table! It helps connect your Tables.<br>
    • A foreign key can have a different name from its primary key<br>
    • It ensures rows in one table have corresponding rows in another<br>
    • Unlike the Primary key, they do not have to be unique. Most often they aren't<br>
    Foreign keys can be null even though primary keys can not<br><br>

    <b>What are transitive functional dependencies?</b><br>
    A transitive functional dependency is when changing a non-key column, might cause any of the other non-key columns to change<br><br>

    <b>3NF (Third Normal Form) Rules</b><br>
    • Rule 1- Be in 2NF<br>
    • Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies<br><br>

    <b>BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)</b><br>
    Even when a database is in 3rd Normal Form, still there would be anomalies resulted if it has more than one Candidate Key. Sometimes is BCNF is also referred as 3.5 Normal Form.<br><br>

    <b> 4NF (Fourth Normal Form) Rules</b><br>
    If no database table instance contains two or more, independent and multivalued data describing the relevant entity, then it is in 4th Normal Form.<br><br>

    <b> 5NF (Fifth Normal Form) Rules</b><br>
    A table is in 5th Normal Form only if it is in 4NF and it cannot be decomposed into any number of smaller tables without loss of data.<br><br>

    <b>6NF (Sixth Normal Form) Proposed</b><br>
    6th Normal Form is not standardized, yet however, it is being discussed by database experts for some time. Hopefully, we would have a clear & standardized definition for 6th Normal Form in the near future.<br><br>

    <b>What is the ER Model?</b><br>
    The <b>ER or (Entity Relational Model)</b> is a high-level conceptual data model diagram. Entity-Relation model is based on the notion of real-world entities and the relationship between them.<br><br>

    <b>History of ER model</b><br>
    ER diagrams are a visual tool which is helpful to represent the ER model. It was proposed by Peter Chen in 1971 to create a uniform convention which can be used for relational database and network. He aimed to use an ER model as a conceptual modeling approach.<br><br>

    <b>What is ER Diagram?</b><br>
    Entity relationship diagram displays the relationships of entity set stored in a database. In other words, we can say that ER diagrams help you to explain the logical structure of databases.<br>
    At first look, an ER diagram looks very similar to the flowchart. However, ER Diagram includes many specialized symbols, and its meanings make this model unique.<br><br>

    <b>Components of the ER Diagram</b><br>
    This model is based on three basic concepts:<br>
    • Entities<br>
    • Attributes<br>
    • Relationships<br><br>

    <b>What is ENTITY?</b><br>
    • A real-world thing either living or non-living that is easily recognizable and non-recognizable. It is anything in the enterprise that is to be represented in our database. It may be a physical thing or simply a fact about the enterprise or an event that happens in the real world.<br><br>
    • An entity can be place, person, object, event or a concept, which stores data in the database. The characteristics of entities are must have an attribute, and a unique key. Every entity is made up of some 'attributes' which represent that entity.<br><br>

    <b>Examples of entities:</b><br>
    <b> Person: </b>Employee, Student, Patient<br>
    <b> Place: </b>Store, Building<br>
    <b> Object:</b> Machine, product, and Car<br>
    <b> Event:</b> Sale, Registration, Renewal<br>
    <b>Concept: </b>Account, Course<br><br>

    <b>Notation of an Entity:</b><br>
    <b>Entity set:</b><br>
    <b>Student</b><br>
    • An entity set is a group of similar kind of entities. It may contain entities with attribute sharing similar values.<br>
    • Entities are represented by their properties, which also called attributes. All attributes have their separate values. For example, a student entity may have a name, age, class, as attributes.<br><br>

    <b>Weak Entities</b><br>
    • A weak entity is a type of entity which doesn't have its key attribute. It can be identified uniquely by considering the primary key of another entity. For that, weak entity sets need to have participation.<br><br>

    <b>Attributes</b><br>

    <b>Different types of cardinal relationships are:</b><br>
    • One-to-One Relationships<br>
    • One-to-Many Relationships<br>
    • Many-to-One Relationships<br>
    • Many-to-Many Relationships <br>
